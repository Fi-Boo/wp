        <h3>Who is the course instructor</h3>
        <p>Trevor</p>

        <h3>Who is your class tutor</h3>
        <p>Trevor</p>

        <h3>Have you any programming or web design experience?</h3>
        <p>The only programming experience I have is from the units in this Bachelor’s degree. My web design experience is from googling and youtubing HTML/CSS.</p>

        <h3>Do you see yourself as a programmer, designer, or both?</h3>
        <p>I am currently enjoying programming and I’ve always had an interest in design, so I’d like to say both.</p>

        <h3>What has brought you to this course at RMIT?</h3>
        <p>I’ve always had an interest in IT and wanted to return to studies. Open Uni had many options and I chose RMIT because I’ve had experience with the university in the past.</p>

        <h3>What are you hoping to get out of the course?</h3>
        <p>A better understanding of web development tools and techniques. I’ve ‘tinkered’ with basic HTML and CSS but I’d like to understand more about them and javascript and PHP.</p>

        <h3>What websites do you use the most?</h3>
        <p>I spend a lot of time 'googling' and 'youtubing'. Ebay and Amazon are my go-to for online shopping, and Netflix and Binge are my media streaming sites. &larr; <i>NB: "family friendly"!</i></p>

        <h3>Do you have any interests or hobbies?</h3>
        <p>I spend most of my time in front of a PC. Most of it is watching media or reading chinese fantasy novels. Other interests include gaming and 'googling' random DIY projects in wood work and basic quality of life ideas (5min hacks!).</p>
